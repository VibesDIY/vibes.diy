# receipt-theater

> Receipt Theater — drop a receipt, friends construct the story. Anyone uploads a receipt photo. Friends submit one-paragraph speculative narratives ('the night this person bought 8 bananas, 3 lottery tickets, and a single pickle...'). Each narrative is a Fireproof doc. The receipt + narratives render as an archive entry: receipt photo on the left, scrolling column of narratives on the right, attributed. A vote-up surfaces the funniest narrative. Past receipts catalogued by month. STYLE — Archive. Load Google Fonts: Playfair Display, Inter (display=optional). Headings in Playfair Display 700 (serif, magazine-archive feel). Body in Inter 400 1rem. Background page-bg oklch(0.92 0.01 65) (warm cream). Surface bg oklch(0.95 0.01 70). Text oklch(0.15 0.02 50) (near-black warm). Borders oklch(0.20 0.02 50) — single hairline 1px. Accent oklch(0.35 0.04 50) (deep sepia) for buttons + emphasis; accent-text oklch(0.95 0.01 70) (cream). Muted oklch(0.55 0.02 50). NO rounded corners (square archive cards). Layout: max-width 920px, generous gutters, two-column where appropriate. Use thin horizontal rules (1px) between sections, small caps tiny labels at 0.55-0.7rem with letter-spacing 0.12em uppercase. Buttons: filled accent bg with cream text; hover deepens. Inputs: bottom-bordered only. Pull-quotes in Playfair italic. Dropped-cap on lead paragraphs. The aesthetic: a museum exhibit catalog. Single-file React with useFireproof; persist drops as catalog entries below the live form, indexed by date.
