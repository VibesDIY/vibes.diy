# mixtape-30s

> 30-Second Mixtape — everyone contributes one half-minute clip per week. The mixtape is a single ordered playlist that the group builds. Each member can record (mic, 30 seconds) or upload (audio file trimmed to 30s) one clip per week. Clips are Fireproof docs. The week's mixtape plays sequentially in submission order. Past mixtapes catalogued by week-of-year, browsable as a chronological archive — each week is a small album-style entry with a serif label and the contributors listed. STYLE — Archive.
