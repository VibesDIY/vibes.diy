# customer-gift-inventory

> Customer Gift Inventory — country regulatory caps + rep request log. Pre-populate gift items (mugs, gift cards, books) with cost-basis. Pre-populate countries with their gifting cap (e.g. US 50, JP 0, DE 30). Reps request gifts for a customer in a specific country. The app validates the request against the country cap and either approves or flags for legal review. Each request is a Fireproof doc; legal review is a separate doc that approves/denies. The home view: pending requests at the top, then a country-by-country gift-spend ledger this quarter. STYLE — Vault. Load Google Fonts: Space Mono, Inter (display=optional). Body Inter 1rem; mono labels in Space Mono for IDs/SKUs/dates. Background bg oklch(0.08 0.03 280) (deep purple-near-black). Cards card-bg oklch(0.12 0.03 280 / 0.7) with backdrop-blur. Borders oklch(0.65 0.15 80 / 0.12) (faint amber-tinted hairlines). Foreground text oklch(0.93 0.02 80) (warm cream). Muted oklch(0.50 0.04 290) (dim purple). Accent oklch(0.72 0.15 75) (warm amber); accent-text oklch(0.10 0.03 280) (near-bg). Secondary purple oklch(0.55 0.18 300) for special states. Sharp corners. Layout: a fixed-width inventory ledger with monospace SKU column, item name in Inter, quantities right-aligned in Space Mono. Status pips: small 8px squares (amber filled = available, dim purple = checked-out, red = missing/overdue). Buttons: amber background, near-bg text, hover deepens to purple. Inputs: transparent with amber bottom-border; quantity inputs are square 64px boxes monospace. Tone: a back-of-house ledger app, not corporate SaaS — low-light warehouse vibes. Single-file React with useFireproof; persist as inventory mutations with full audit log below.
