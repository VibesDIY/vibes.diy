> Conference Booth Gear — banners, scanners, cables, lives in a Sheet. Pre-populate with categories (BANNERS, SCANNERS, CABLES, LIGHTING, FURNITURE, AV, MISC). Each item has SKU, description, condition, current location (warehouse / event-name / in-transit). Plan a conference: list which items are committed to which event, with checkout-date and return-date. Each commitment is a Fireproof doc. The home view: a table per category with status pips. A 'committed elsewhere' warning if you try to double-book. Past events catalogued by date with a checklist of what came back. STYLE — Vault. Load Google Fonts: Space Mono, Inter (display=optional). Body Inter 1rem; mono labels in Space Mono for IDs/SKUs/dates. Background bg oklch(0.08 0.03 280) (deep purple-near-black). Cards card-bg oklch(0.12 0.03 280 / 0.7) with backdrop-blur. Borders oklch(0.65 0.15 80 / 0.12) (faint amber-tinted hairlines). Foreground text oklch(0.93 0.02 80) (warm cream). Muted oklch(0.50 0.04 290) (dim purple). Accent oklch(0.72 0.15 75) (warm amber); accent-text oklch(0.10 0.03 280) (near-bg). Secondary purple oklch(0.55 0.18 300) for special states. Sharp corners. Layout: a fixed-width inventory ledger with monospace SKU column, item name in Inter, quantities right-aligned in Space Mono. Status pips: small 8px squares (amber filled = available, dim purple = checked-out, red = missing/overdue). Buttons: amber background, near-bg text, hover deepens to purple. Inputs: transparent with amber bottom-border; quantity inputs are square 64px boxes monospace. Tone: a back-of-house ledger app, not corporate SaaS — low-light warehouse vibes. Single-file React with useFireproof; persist as inventory mutations with full audit log below.
