# phone-as-blacklight

> Phone-as-Blacklight — a shared UV-simulation overlay for parties. The app opens the phone camera and renders the feed with a simulated UV-blacklight filter (heavy purple/violet tint, brightness boost on whites, glow on light surfaces). Tap [ SCAN ] to capture a freeze-frame and tag it (LINT, GLOW, SECRET) — saved as a Fireproof doc { uri, tag, by, ts }. The party gallery below shows everyone's scans in a wall layout — see what was 'invisible' at the party, in chronological order. A toggle adjusts UV intensity (LOW / MID / HIGH). STYLE — Aether Brass. Load Google Fonts: Cinzel Decorative, Homemade Apple, Special Elite (display=optional). Body font Special Elite, monospace, 1rem. Background parchment #dcbfa6 with a subtle paper-grain (a faint repeating-linear-gradient at 1-2% opacity for grain). Text ink #3e2723. Surfaces parchment-dark #c4a482. Accents brass-mid #cfa562 / brass-dark #745428 / amber #ffaa00. Decorative elements only: brass-foil corners on cards, double-rule borders (2px solid + 1px inset offset 4px) like an antique label. Headings in Cinzel Decorative, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.08em, brass-dark color. Special accents in Homemade Apple (handwritten cursive). Buttons: brass-mid border, rounded 0px corners, hover fills brass-dark with parchment text. Inputs: transparent bg with bottom border ink, type-on-parchment feel. Tone: late-night radio operator, leather-bound logbook, faint static warmth. Single-file React with useFireproof; persist activity as Fireproof docs and render past entries below the live surface.
