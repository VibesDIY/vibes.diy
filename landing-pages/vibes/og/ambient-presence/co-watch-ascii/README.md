# co-watch-ascii

> Co-Watch with ASCII Reactions — sync-watch a video URL together with friends. The host pastes a YouTube/Vimeo URL; viewers join with the same room code. The video plays in sync (track host's currentTime in Fireproof). Below the video: a real-time ASCII overlay where reactions from each viewer render as floating ASCII text (LOL, WTF, ヽ(•‿•)ノ, *cry*) that fade over 3 seconds. Each reaction is a Fireproof doc { viewer, ascii, ts }. A timestamped reaction log replays per viewer at the bottom. Tone: silent movie palace with caption cards. STYLE — Aether Brass. Load Google Fonts: Cinzel Decorative, Homemade Apple, Special Elite (display=optional). Body font Special Elite, monospace, 1rem. Background parchment #dcbfa6 with a subtle paper-grain (a faint repeating-linear-gradient at 1-2% opacity for grain). Text ink #3e2723. Surfaces parchment-dark #c4a482. Accents brass-mid #cfa562 / brass-dark #745428 / amber #ffaa00. Decorative elements only: brass-foil corners on cards, double-rule borders (2px solid + 1px inset offset 4px) like an antique label. Headings in Cinzel Decorative, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.08em, brass-dark color. Special accents in Homemade Apple (handwritten cursive). Buttons: brass-mid border, rounded 0px corners, hover fills brass-dark with parchment text. Inputs: transparent bg with bottom border ink, type-on-parchment feel. Tone: late-night radio operator, leather-bound logbook, faint static warmth. Single-file React with useFireproof; persist activity as Fireproof docs and render past entries below the live surface.
