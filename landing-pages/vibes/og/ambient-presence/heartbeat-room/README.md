# heartbeat-room

> Heartbeat Room — a shared bpm wall. Each user's phone camera reads pulse from a fingertip held over the lens (use existing PPG techniques — measure brightness variation in the red channel over a 15-second window to detect bpm, fall back to manual tap-to-bpm if camera reading fails). Each user broadcasts their bpm as a Fireproof doc per measurement. The room view is a grid of named tiles, each pulsing visually at that user's bpm with a soft circular glow. A central readout shows ROOM AVERAGE BPM. A history below shows each user's bpm sparkline over the session. STYLE — Aether Brass. Load Google Fonts: Cinzel Decorative, Homemade Apple, Special Elite (display=optional). Body font Special Elite, monospace, 1rem. Background parchment #dcbfa6 with a subtle paper-grain (a faint repeating-linear-gradient at 1-2% opacity for grain). Text ink #3e2723. Surfaces parchment-dark #c4a482. Accents brass-mid #cfa562 / brass-dark #745428 / amber #ffaa00. Decorative elements only: brass-foil corners on cards, double-rule borders (2px solid + 1px inset offset 4px) like an antique label.
