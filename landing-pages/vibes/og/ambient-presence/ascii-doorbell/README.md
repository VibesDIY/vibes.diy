# ascii-doorbell

> ASCII Doorbell — a group-house front-door cam in ASCII. Designate one phone as the DOOR (it streams its camera as an ASCII grid). Other roommates open the app and see the latest 30-second loop of ASCII frames. When the doorbell rings (a [ RING ] button on the door device), every roommate's app pulses a notification card with the last 5 seconds of ASCII video. Each ring is a Fireproof doc { ts, ascii_frames, answered }. Roommates can tap [ I'LL GET IT ] to claim the answer; the door device shows who's coming. Below: a 7-day log of rings with answer status. STYLE — Aether Brass. Load Google Fonts: Cinzel Decorative, Homemade Apple, Special Elite (display=optional). Body font Special Elite, monospace, 1rem. Background parchment #dcbfa6 with a subtle paper-grain (a faint repeating-linear-gradient at 1-2% opacity for grain). Text ink #3e2723. Surfaces parchment-dark #c4a482. Accents brass-mid #cfa562 / brass-dark #745428 / amber #ffaa00. Decorative elements only: brass-foil corners on cards, double-rule borders (2px solid + 1px inset offset 4px) like an antique label. Headings in Cinzel Decorative, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.08em, brass-dark color. Special accents in Homemade Apple (handwritten cursive). Buttons: brass-mid border, rounded 0px corners, hover fills brass-dark with parchment text. Inputs: transparent bg with bottom border ink, type-on-parchment feel. Tone: late-night radio operator, leather-bound logbook, faint static warmth. Single-file React with useFireproof; persist activity as Fireproof docs and render past entries below the live surface.
