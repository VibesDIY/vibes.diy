# reading-room

> Reading-Right-Now Room — a presence-as-bookmark app for a small book-loving friend group. Each member submits one current book at a time: title, author, current page. Submitting writes a Fireproof doc { name, title, author, page, ts }. The latest doc per name is the live state. Render a single column of cards, one per member, each showing: name, book title (large, glowing green), author (dim), and a horizontal progress bar with current page over a user-supplied total page count (default 300). Pages are typed in by the user and updated by tapping a +1, +5, +10 page button on your own card. Below the cards: a feed of the last 40 page-bumps and book switches: "meno bumped 'Annihilation' p.142 → 168 (15m ago)". Add a single textarea per card for an optional one-line passage quote saved alongside the page bump. No comments, no replies, no following — just shared bookmarks. STYLE — Terminal CRT phosphor display. Load Google Font VT323 (display=optional); body font is "VT323", monospace, font-size 18px, line-height 1.4. Background --bg oklch(0.16 0 0) near-black. Surface --terminal oklch(0 0 0 / 0.85). Foreground --green oklch(0.87 0.30 142) phosphor-green; muted --green-dim oklch(0.87 0.30 142 / 0.4); borders --green-border oklch(0.87 0.30 142 / 0.3); faint fills --green-faint oklch(0.87 0.30 142 / 0.1); pure --white oklch(1 0 0) reserved for accents. Apply text-shadow: 0 0 10px oklch(0.87 0.30 142 / 0.7) on h1/h2/key numbers. Add a fixed full-screen CRT overlay (repeating-linear-gradient horizontal scanlines, rgba(0,255,0,0.03), 1px every 3px, pointer-events none, z-index 99). Add a 3px-tall scan-line sweep bar (gradient bottom-fade) animating top→bottom over 8s infinite, z-index 100. Status indicators are 6px round dots: active = solid --green with box-shadow 0 0 8px green-glow; inactive = --green-dim, no glow. Section labels uppercase, letter-spacing 0.1em, --green-dim, prefixed "SYS:" or "STATUS:" or "FEED:" where appropriate. Inputs and textareas: transparent bg, 1px solid --green-border, square corners, monospace caret blinks. Buttons render as bracketed text "[ RUN ]" "[ PING ]" "[ CLEAR ]" with hover changing to filled-green-on-black inverse. No emoji icons; use ASCII symbols or unicode block characters (▌ █ ░ ▒ ● ○ ▲ ▼ →). No rounded corners on cards, only on the 6px dots. Card frames are 1px --green-border with --terminal background. Build single-file React. Persist all writes as Fireproof docs via useFireproof; render past entries below the input as a reverse-chronological list inside the Terminal aesthetic.
