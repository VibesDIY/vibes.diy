# rfp-comparison

> Procurement RFP Comparison — buyer-specific weighting matrix. The user defines criteria for an RFP (e.g. PRICE 30%, FEATURES 25%, SECURITY 20%, SUPPORT 15%, ROADMAP 10%) — weights sum to 100%. Add vendors with their bid: each criterion gets a score 1-5. The matrix calculates each vendor's weighted total live. Vendors auto-rank. Each scoring update is a Fireproof doc. Notes per (vendor × criterion) for justification. Export the matrix as a one-page summary. Past RFPs catalogued by date + winning vendor. STYLE — Dossier Card. Load Google Fonts: Archivo Black, Roboto Mono (display=optional). Body Roboto Mono 1rem (monospace). Display headings Archivo Black, uppercase, letter-spacing -0.02em (heavy slab-bold). Background bg oklch(0.16 0 0) (near-black). Card surfaces oklch(0 0 0) (pure black). Foreground oklch(1 0 0) (pure white). Border oklch(0.28 0.03 257) (cool blue-gray) 1px hairline. NO color outside black/white plus the cool blue-gray border tint and a single subtle accent stripe (use border tone for it). Sharp corners. Layout is a numbered briefing book: each section labeled "EXHIBIT 01 / EXHIBIT 02 / ..." in Archivo Black. Tables in Roboto Mono with clear cell borders. Buttons render as bordered rectangles "[ FILE ]" with Archivo Black uppercase text; hover inverts to white-bg black-text. Inputs: transparent with cool-blue-gray bottom border, mono caret. Tone: an executive briefing dossier — confidential, weighty, paper-binder feel. NO playful elements. Single-file React with useFireproof; persist briefings as numbered exhibit entries.
