# recruiter-pipeline

> Recruiter Pipeline Tracker — flat ATS doesn't fit each recruiter's flow. Each recruiter customizes their own stages (e.g. SOURCED / PHONE-SCREEN / TAKE-HOME / ONSITE / OFFER / CLOSED-WIN / CLOSED-LOSS). Add candidates with name, role, source, current stage, last-touch-date, next-action. Each stage move is a Fireproof doc. The home view: a strict pipeline table sorted by stage, with stale-candidates (no touch >7 days) flagged. A weekly metrics block: total in pipeline, moved this week, lost this week. Per-candidate detail page shows full audit log of stage moves. STYLE — Dossier Card. Load Google Fonts: Archivo Black, Roboto Mono (display=optional). Body Roboto Mono 1rem (monospace). Display headings Archivo Black, uppercase, letter-spacing -0.02em (heavy slab-bold). Background bg oklch(0.16 0 0) (near-black). Card surfaces oklch(0 0 0) (pure black). Foreground oklch(1 0 0) (pure white). Border oklch(0.28 0.03 257) (cool blue-gray) 1px hairline. NO color outside black/white plus the cool blue-gray border tint and a single subtle accent stripe (use border tone for it). Sharp corners. Layout is a numbered briefing book: each section labeled "EXHIBIT 01 / EXHIBIT 02 / ..." in Archivo Black. Tables in Roboto Mono with clear cell borders. Buttons render as bordered rectangles "[ FILE ]" with Archivo Black uppercase text; hover inverts to white-bg black-text. Inputs: transparent with cool-blue-gray bottom border, mono caret. Tone: an executive briefing dossier — confidential, weighty, paper-binder feel. NO playful elements. Single-file React with useFireproof; persist briefings as numbered exhibit entries.
