# ipo-roadshow

> IPO Roadshow Choreography — a multi-city, multi-meeting day-of operational app. The user (an IR lead or banker) sets up a roadshow: list of cities (NYC, Boston, SF, etc), and per-city meetings as rows: time, investor name, attendees, location/room, status. Submitting a roadshow writes a Fireproof doc { roadshowId, name, cities, meetings: [...] }. The home view is a strict black-and-white grid: today\'s city banner across the top, then the meetings table with columns TIME / INVESTOR / ROOM / STATUS / NOTES. Each meeting row click expands inline notes (textarea) and a status toggle that cycles UPCOMING → IN PROGRESS → DONE → MISSED. Status changes write Fireproof docs { meetingId, status, ts, by }. A second view shows ALL CITIES at a glance: rows of cities with progress dots. A start-of-day timer counts down to the first meeting. Three top stats: meetings done / total, investors covered, road score (% on time). STYLE — Broadsheet. Body font Helvetica Neue / Helvetica / Arial sans-serif. Background pure white #fff, foreground pure black #000, single hairline borders 1px solid #000 between every grid cell. NO rounded corners anywhere — every box, button, input, and card is sharp-cornered. Layout in a max-width 1000px column with a vertical 1px black border on the left and right of the page. Hero uses a 200px / 1fr / 200px three-column band with thin black borders, a giant outline-only display headline (font-size clamp(3rem,10vw,8rem), font-weight 900, -webkit-text-stroke 2px #000, color transparent, letter-spacing -0.04em, uppercase). Section headers are tiny: font-size 0.55rem–0.7rem, font-weight 700, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.08–0.12em. Filled section labels use background #000 / color #fff. Tables use a strict CSS grid: each row is a grid-template-columns line with 1px black row borders and 1px black cell borders; row hover inverts to bg:#000 color:#fff. Forms use bottom-bordered inputs only (border:none; border-bottom:1px solid #000; transparent bg) with tiny uppercase labels. Buttons are square: padding 0.75rem 1.5rem, background:#fff, 1px solid #000, color #000, uppercase 0.65rem 700-weight letter-spacing 0.08em, hover inverts to bg:#000 color:#fff. Checkboxes are 16px black-bordered squares that fill black when checked. Toggles are 36×18 black-bordered tracks with a 12×12 sliding knob. NO color outside #000, #fff, and #666 for muted secondary text. NO emoji or icons — use small black SVG strokes or simple unicode arrows (›, →, ▲) where needed. Persist all writes as Fireproof docs via useFireproof; render past entries below the form as a strict bordered table. Single-file React.
