# Vibes DIY Code of Conduct

### **Our Commitment**

Vibes DIY is an open source community for building, learning, and sharing together.

We believe the best work happens in spaces where people feel safe, respected, and encouraged to participate fully.

We are committed to creating a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of background, identity, experience level, or technical perspective. This Code of Conduct exists to support that goal and to help us take care of one another as a community.

We ask all community members, contributors, and participants to help create a positive environment by:

* Treating others with respect, kindness, and consideration

* Communicating thoughtfully, even when you disagree

* Giving and receiving feedback in good faith

* Staying focused on what is best for the community and the project

To be clear, the following behaviors are not acceptable in any Vibes DIY community space:

* Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech of any kind

* Personal attacks, insults, or sustained hostility

* Offering guidance or issuing a warning

* Removing comments, commits, or other content

All reports will be reviewed thoughtfully and handled as confidentially as possible. Our goal is not just enforcement, but care. We strive to ensure people feel heard, supported, and safe participating in the community.
