# useChat Hook Simplification Notes

## Core Architecture

The `useChat` hook should follow a data-driven approach with these key principles:

1. **Direct state management**: No callbacks for passing data between components
2. **Single source of truth**: Messages array as the primary state container
3. **Pure content parsing**: Stateless, functional parsing of content
4. **Typed message discrimination**: Clear type separation between user and AI messages

## External APIs

- `fetch`: Used for API calls to OpenRouter
- `TextDecoder`: For decoding stream chunks


## Essential State

```typescript
// Core state needed
const [messages, setMessages] = useState<ChatMessage[]>([]);  // Primary message store
const [input, setInput] = useState<string>('');               // Current user input
const [isGenerating, setIsGenerating] = useState(false);      // Message generation status
const [systemPrompt, setSystemPrompt] = useState('');         // System prompt

// Refs for tracking without re-renders
const streamBufferRef = useRef<string>('');                  // Accumulated stream content
```

## Return Values

```typescript
// Only what components actually need
return {
  messages,                // All messages in the conversation
  input,                   // Current user input text
  setInput,                // Function to update input
  isGenerating,            // Whether a message is being generated
  sendMessage,             // Function to send a message
  currentSegments,         // Segments of the current/last message and code (derived)
};
```

## Message Types

```typescript
// Type definitions (simplified)
type UserChatMessage = {
  type: 'user';
  text: string;
  timestamp?: number;
};

type AiChatMessage = {
  type: 'ai';
  text: string;            // Raw text content
  segments: Segment[];     // Parsed segments
  dependenciesString?: string; // Raw dependencies for downstream parsing
  isStreaming?: boolean;   // Whether this message is currently streaming
  timestamp?: number;
};

type Segment = {
  type: 'markdown' | 'code';
  content: string;
};

type ChatMessage = UserChatMessage | AiChatMessage;
```

## Content Parsing Specifics
  1. Language tags: Ignore language tags after backticks (e.g., ```javascript should be treated the same as ```)
  2. Single code block: The parser assumes there will be at most one code block per AI response
  3. Segment structure: Always follows pattern of dependencies → markdown → code → markdown (some segments may be empty, assume it starts with dependencies)
  4. Dependencies: Should be extracted from the first segment, it ends with `}}`

## Key Functions

1. **sendMessage**: Sends user message and processes AI response
2. **parseContent**: Parses text into segments
3. **extractDependenciesString**: Extracts dependencies string from first segment

## Content Flow

1. User inputs text → `sendMessage`
2. Add user message to `messages`
3. Add placeholder AI message to `messages` with `isStreaming: true`
4. Fetch from API with streaming
5. For each chunk:
   - Add to `streamBufferRef`
   - Parse full buffer into dependencies and segments when updating 
6. On stream completion:
   - Force final update
   - Set `isStreaming: false` on the AI message
   

## Error Handling

On error:
1. Log error for debugging, throw

## Advantages Over Current Implementation

1. **Simplicity**: No complex event system or callbacks
2. **Predictability**: Clear data flow from API to UI
4. **Type Safety**: Discriminated union types for messages
5. **Maintainability**: Pure functions for content parsing
6. **Testability**: Easier to test with pure functions and direct data access

## Integration Points

- **ChatInterface**: Uses `currentCode` directly for Sandpack 
- **MessageList**: Renders `messages` with their segments
- **StructuredMessage**: Renders individual segments based on type
- **ChatInput**: Uses `input`, `setInput`, and `sendMessage`

## Implementation Challenges & Tips

2. **Backtick Handling**:
   - Streaming content may contain incomplete backtick blocks
   - Parser should be robust enough to handle partial code blocks during streaming
   - The final parsing pass should produce the definitive segments
   - Parsing happens after chunk join, and gets the full buffer

3. **Simple Dependencies Extraction**:
   - Don't try to parse JSON dependencies in the zeroth segment
   - Just extract the raw string ending with `}}` and let downstream components handle it
   - Avoid regex complexity in the initial implementation

5. **Testing**:
   - Test with partially streamed backtick blocks
   - Test with multiple code blocks (even though only one is expected)
   - Test with missing or malformed dependencies sections
   - Test error cases to ensure graceful degradation
   - Repurpose existing test buffercontent

6. **State Updates**:
   - Consider using functional updates with `setMessages(prev => ...)` to avoid race conditions
   - Ensure the final message accurately reflects the complete streamed content
   - Raw content should be persisted to the session and parsed on reload, dont save parsed content

## High-Level Goals and Implementation Challenges

The simplified implementation aims to achieve these high-level goals:

1. **Unified Parsing Logic**:  
   - Use a single, consistent parsing approach for both streaming and completed AI responses.
   - Ensure the same parsing logic applies regardless of whether content is streaming or fully loaded, avoiding duplicated or divergent parsing paths.

2. **Consistent User Experience**:
   - Provide clean, incremental updates to the user interface during streaming, ensuring the UI remains responsive and informative.
   - Clearly indicate when code is being generated, including displaying the current line count of the code segment.
   - Offer a convenient "Copy" button for users to easily copy generated code, without displaying the full code content directly in the message.

3. **Simplified Data Flow**:
   - Maintain a single, unified data flow from API responses through parsing to UI rendering.
   - Avoid callbacks or event-driven complexity; rely solely on state-driven updates to ensure predictability and ease of debugging.

4. **Robustness Across States**:
   - Ensure the parsing logic gracefully handles partial content during streaming, as well as complete content after streaming finishes.
   - Clearly distinguish between streaming and completed states in the UI, providing visual cues to the user.

These goals guide the simplified implementation, ensuring maintainability, clarity, and a high-quality user experience.

9. **tests/**
   - Update test fixtures for new message structure
   - Add tests for content parsing edge cases

## Implementation Progress

We've implemented the core parts of the simplified chat hook architecture:

1. **Data-Driven Types** - Created discriminated union types for messages that clearly separate user and AI messages:
   ```typescript
   export type UserChatMessage = {
     type: 'user';
     text: string;
     timestamp?: number;
   };

   export type AiChatMessage = {
     type: 'ai';
     text: string;
     segments: Segment[];
     dependenciesString?: string;
     isStreaming?: boolean;
     timestamp?: number;
   };

   export type ChatMessage = UserChatMessage | AiChatMessage;
   ```

2. **useSimpleChat Hook** - Implemented a new hook with focused responsibilities:
   - Manages message state with clear types
   - Provides a pure content parser that doesn't rely on event emitters
   - Exposes stable, minimal API for components
   - Handles streaming with direct buffer updates

3. **StructuredMessage Component** - Created a component that:
   - Displays markdown and code segments distinctly
   - Shows a preview of code with line count rather than inline code
   - Provides a copy button for code segments
   - Visually indicates streaming status

4. **MessageList Integration** - Updated the message list to:
   - Use StructuredMessage for AI responses
   - Remove dependency on currentStreamedText
   - Check for streaming messages within the messages array

## Lessons Learned

During implementation, we discovered several important insights:

1. **Pure Parsing Is Simpler** - Content parsing as a pure function is easier to test and reason about than the event-based parser.

2. **State-Derived Data Works Better** - Using computed values from state (like `currentSegments()`) provides a cleaner architecture than maintaining multiple state variables.

3. **Discriminated Unions Improve Type Safety** - User vs AI message types with explicit discrimination fields make the code more robust.

4. **Migration Complexity** - Updating a central hook like this affects many components and requires careful migration planning, especially for persisted message data.

5. **Streaming Simplification** - By modifying the message directly in the array and using an `isStreaming` flag, we eliminated the need for separate streaming state variables.

## Next Steps

To complete this implementation, we need to:

1. **Fix ChatInterface Integration** - The current implementation has several type errors related to the new message structure. We should:
   - Complete the migration of the ChatInterface component
   - Update the context provider to work with the new message types
   - Fix type errors related to the Sandpack integration

2. **Add Session Migration Logic** - Create robust migration logic for existing chat sessions with the old message format.

3. **Update Tests** - Migrate existing tests to the new format and add new tests for:
   - Content parsing edge cases
   - Streaming behavior
   - Message type discrimination

4. **Add Usage Documentation** - Document how to use the new hook and components properly.

5. **Performance Testing** - Verify that the new implementation doesn't impact performance, especially during streaming.
