# Current Implementation Status

## Solution Implemented
We've successfully simplified how streaming state is managed in the `ResultPreview` component:

1. Removed the explicit `isStreaming` function prop and replaced it with a local useMemo that infers streaming state from `streamingCode`
2. Updated all related components (`SandpackEventListener` and `SandpackScrollController`) to use a boolean instead of a function
3. Updated tests to work with the new API

## Resolved Issues
- Removed the need for an explicit `isStreaming` function prop throughout the component hierarchy
- Fixed all linter errors in the test files
- Fixed the component test issues by updating selectors to be more specific
- Prevented unnecessary re-renders with improved dependency arrays

## Remaining Challenges
There are still a few issues unrelated to our implementation:

1. Some application tests are failing due to unrelated issues in the `useDocument` function in the `useSession` hook
2. There may be some remaining issues with multiple elements having the same test IDs in the application

## Next Steps
1. Run the application to verify that the UI works correctly in a real environment
2. Consider adding unique test IDs to elements in the DOM to improve test reliability
3. Monitor for any performance issues or unexpected re-renders during usage

The overall approach of inferring streaming state from props is more maintainable than passing functions through the component hierarchy and reduces the risk of dependency array issues in useEffect hooks.
