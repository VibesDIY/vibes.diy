# Current Implementation Challenges

## Issue Summary
We've been updating the `ResultPreview` component to use `isStreaming` as a function instead of a boolean value, which required several changes:

1. Modified `ResultPreview.tsx` to accept `isStreaming` as a function that returns a boolean
2. Fixed the dependency arrays in useEffect hooks to use the function reference instead of calling it
3. Updated tests in `ResultPreview.test.tsx` to provide `isStreaming` as a function

## Current Problems
Despite these changes, the app is not rendering properly. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Test Failures**: There are still 8 linter errors in the `ResultPreview.test.tsx` file where `isStreaming` prop is missing in the test renders.

2. **Multiple Elements Issue**: The tests are failing with `TestingLibraryElementError` errors because multiple elements with the same data-testid (`sandpack-provider`) are being found in the DOM.

3. **Component Rendering**: The actual application may not be rendering correctly due to the changes in how `isStreaming` is used in dependency arrays and component logic.

## Next Steps
1. Fix all tests in `ResultPreview.test.tsx` to provide the required `isStreaming` function prop
2. Address the issue with multiple elements with the same data-testid
3. Verify that `ResultPreview` component correctly uses the `isStreaming` function without calling it in dependency arrays
4. Ensure that `SandpackProvider` has a unique key that prevents unnecessary remounts
5. Confirm the relationship between `ResultPreview`, `MessageList`, and the parent routes (`home.tsx` and `session.tsx`) to make sure `isStreaming` is being passed and used consistently

## Implementation Details
The key change was modifying how `isStreaming` works in the `ResultPreview` component:

```tsx
// Old approach with direct calls in dependency arrays:
useEffect(() => {
  // Logic here
}, [code, isStreaming(), streamingCode]);

// New approach with function reference in dependency arrays:
useEffect(() => {
  // Logic here 
}, [code, isStreaming, streamingCode]);
```

This prevents unnecessary re-renders and ensures proper reactivity. The approach is consistent with how `MessageList.tsx` handles `isStreaming` as well.
