# `eval/codegen-matrix` — cross-model codegen eval harness

## Goal

A repeatable harness that runs a fixed set of prompts across a configurable set
of models and scores each `(model × prompt)` cell on three factors: **speed**,
**adherence** (to the codegen system prompt), and **design quality**.

The defining constraint: **adding a future model is a one-line edit to a JSON
config — no code change.** The harness is meant to be re-run as new models land
on the platform.

Cost is deliberately _not_ a factor the harness computes. It is a post-eval
filter the operator applies to the result table (cheapest model that clears an
adherence/design bar). See "Out of scope".

## Why this is a new package, not an extension of `eval/codegen-edit`

`eval/codegen-edit` exists to harden the SEARCH/REPLACE parser: it drives the
generation flow **in-process** (importing `chat.sectionStream`,
`createFileSystemStream`), archives every section event for offline replay, and
deliberately **skips deploy** (`pushFromDir`). Its scope is model→parser.

`codegen-matrix` has a different scope (model→model comparison on observable
output quality) and a different mechanism: it shells out to the **published
CLI's `generate`**, which deploys the app and triggers a server-side
screenshot. Mixing the two would tangle parser-corpus concerns with
model-comparison concerns the original PLAN kept separate. So it lands as a
sibling package, reusing primitives where they fit (the `eval` handle
convention, the `call-ai` direct-call pattern from `preamble-probe`).

## Architecture — four stages, each independently runnable

Each stage reads the previous stage's artifacts off disk, so any stage can be
re-run without repeating the expensive one before it (e.g. re-score without
re-generating).

```
config/  →  generate  →  score  →  report
            (stage 2)    (stage 3) (stage 4)
```

### Stage 1 — Config

Two checked-in files under `eval/codegen-matrix/config/`:

`matrix.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "cliCommand": "npx vibes-diy@latest", // the generate mechanism; pinnable
  "handle": "eval", // publish namespace
  "judgeModel": "anthropic/claude-opus-4.5",
  "reps": 3, // runs per cell; report median/mean
  "screenshotTimeoutMs": 120000, // poll budget for screenshot.jpg
  "models": [
    { "id": "anthropic/claude-opus-4.6-fast", "class": "anthropic", "tier": "expensive" },
    { "id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6", "class": "anthropic", "tier": "cheap" },
    { "id": "google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview", "class": "google", "tier": "expensive" },
    { "id": "google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite", "class": "google", "tier": "cheap" },
    // …cheapest + priciest per class; add a future model = add a line
  ],
}
```

`prompts.jsonl` — three entries spanning distinct capability surfaces:

```jsonc
{"id":"collab-lists","prompt":"Multi-list todo app. A list creator sees only their own lists and can invite collaborators per list; invited collaborators see only the lists shared with them. Persist lists, items, and per-list membership in Fireproof."}
{"id":"audio-synth","prompt":"Web Audio synthesizer with a playable keyboard and an ADSR envelope (attack/decay/sustain/release sliders) that shapes each note. No external audio libraries."}
{"id":"recipe-shop","prompt":"Recipe to smart shopping list. Enter a recipe; use callAI with a JSON schema to extract ingredients into structured docs; tapping an item toggles 'have it' with optimistic Fireproof writes and a per-row saving cue; a button uses callAI to suggest substitutions."}
```

Rationale for the three: `collab-lists` is the hardest adherence target (forces
a correct `access.js` channel/grant model); `audio-synth` is deliberately
off-stack (no Fireproof/callAI — tests raw Web Audio + the no-emoji/inline-SVG
design rules); `recipe-shop` stresses the callAI-schema + optimistic-write
rules neither other prompt touches.

### Stage 2 — Create loop (`src/generate.ts`)

The create loop is _only_ calls to the published CLI's `generate`, one per
`model × prompt × rep`. For each cell:

1. Make a per-cell working dir `runs/<ts>/<promptId>__<modelSlug>__r<rep>/`.
2. Run `<cliCommand> generate --model <id> --handle <handle> "<prompt>"` in
   that dir, capturing stdout. The CLI emits a `vibes-diy.cli.res-generate`
   event with `{ appSlug, ownerHandle, url, directory }`.
3. Record wall-clock latency (spawn → exit) and exit state.
4. The CLI writes the generated files into `<directory>` (`<cwd>/<appSlug>/`);
   leave them in place for the rubric.
5. Write `cell.json`: `{ promptId, model, class, tier, rep, appSlug,
ownerHandle, url, directory, latencyMs, exitState, stderrTail }`.

Runs are **sequential** — parallelizing risks rate-limit errors that pollute
results with infrastructure noise (same rationale as `codegen-edit`).

`generate` deploys to production under the `eval` handle and the platform
captures a screenshot asynchronously; the harness does not render anything
itself.

### Stage 3 — Scoring (`src/score.ts`)

Three scorers run over each cell's `cell.json` + generated files:

**Speed** — `latencyMs` from stage 2. Report median across reps. Free; no new
instrumentation.

**Adherence** — two layers, both written to `cell.score.json`:

- _Deterministic rubric_ (`src/rubric.ts`) over the generated files. Each rule
  is a boolean derived statically from the codegen system prompt
  (`prompts/pkg/system-prompt.md`):
  - `App.jsx` present and contains `export default function App(`
  - ES module imports at top; no bare `React.`/library globals
  - a classNames/`c` object is used and no raw `bg-[#…]`/`text-[#…]` bracket
    colors appear directly in JSX
  - no component (function returning JSX) defined inside `App`
  - `callAI(...)` used with a `{ schema: { properties } }` shape when the prompt
    calls for AI
  - no emoji codepoints in the UI (inline SVG only)
  - if an access function is present it is a separate `access.js`, never inline
    in `App.jsx`

  Each rule contributes to a rubric score `passed / total`. The rule set lives
  in one file so it tracks the system prompt as that evolves.

- _LLM feature-completeness judge_ (`src/judge.ts`) — did the app actually
  build what the prompt asked? Sends the prompt + generated `App.jsx`
  (+ `access.js`) to `judgeModel` via the `call-ai` direct-call path, asking for
  a 1–5 score and a one-line justification. Uses the same `LLM_BACKEND_URL` /
  `LLM_BACKEND_API_KEY` transport `preamble-probe` reads from
  `vibes.diy/pkg/.dev.vars`.

**Design** — fetch the deployed screenshot and vision-judge it:

1. Build the screenshot URL from the cell's `appSlug`/`ownerHandle`
   (`https://<appSlug>--<ownerHandle>.<hostnameBase>/screenshot.jpg`, the same
   image the `/vibe/` viewer exposes as `og:image`).
2. Poll it (capture lags the deploy) up to `screenshotTimeoutMs`; on success,
   pass the image to `judgeModel` as an image input with a design rubric
   (layout, hierarchy, contrast, polish, no-emoji adherence) → 1–5 + one line.
3. On timeout, record `design: { available: false }` rather than failing the
   cell.

### Stage 4 — Report (`src/report.ts`)

Joins all `cell.score.json` into:

- `runs/<ts>/index.jsonl` — one row per cell (machine-readable).
- `runs/<ts>/summary.md` — a matrix table: rows = model (with class/tier),
  columns grouped by prompt × {speed median, adherence rubric, feature judge,
  design judge}. Aggregates reps (median speed, mean scores).

Cost is **not** in the report. The operator joins the table against pricing
(already available from the OpenRouter `/models` endpoint, no token) as a
post-eval filter.

## Workspace layout

```
eval/codegen-matrix/
  package.json              # private workspace; add to root pnpm-workspace.yaml
  README.md
  config/
    matrix.json
    prompts.jsonl
  src/
    generate.ts             # stage 2: model × prompt → deploy via CLI generate
    score.ts                # stage 3 orchestrator
    rubric.ts               # deterministic system-prompt checks
    judge.ts                # call-ai feature + design judges
    report.ts               # stage 4: index.jsonl + summary.md
    config.ts               # load/validate matrix.json + prompts.jsonl
    cell.ts                 # per-cell path + artifact read/write helpers
  runs/                     # gitignored — generated outputs
    .gitignore
```

## Repeatability contract

- New model → add one entry to `matrix.json.models`. No code change.
- New prompt → add one line to `prompts.jsonl`.
- Re-score without re-generating → run stage 3/4 against an existing
  `runs/<ts>/`.
- Pin the platform behavior → set `cliCommand` to a specific
  `vibes-diy@<version>`.

## Error handling

- A `generate` non-zero exit or empty `directory` → cell marked
  `exitState: "generate-failed"` with `stderrTail`; scoring skips it but the
  report still lists the cell (a model that can't produce output is signal).
- Judge transport failure → that score recorded as `null`; other scores still
  land.
- Screenshot timeout → `design.available: false`; cell otherwise scored.

## Testing

- `config.ts`: unit tests for matrix/prompts parsing + validation (bad model
  entry, empty prompt).
- `rubric.ts`: unit tests with fixture `App.jsx` files — one that passes every
  rule, and targeted failures (inline component, raw bracket color, emoji,
  missing `export default`, access logic inside `App.jsx`).
- `cell.ts`: path/slug derivation and artifact round-trip.
- `generate.ts`/`judge.ts`: network-dependent; covered by a manual smoke run,
  not unit tests (mirrors how `codegen-edit`/`preamble-probe` treat their
  network paths).

## Out of scope (v1)

- Cost computation — post-eval filter applied to the report.
- Multi-turn edit sequences — create-only (single `generate` call per cell).
- CI integration — manual runs for now.
- Compilation/runtime correctness beyond what the screenshot reveals — we score
  observable output, not a test suite per generated app.
